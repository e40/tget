rss reader

package: net.rss





(net.rss:read-feed "url")

    Reads the feed at the given url, parses the data in feed
and returns a lisp data structure holding the data.

The current supported feed types are:
    rss version 0.91
    rss version 1.0
    rss version 2.0

rss version 2.0 is a follow on to version 0.91  
rss version 1.0 is very different

We return the same data structure regardless of the type
of the rss feed.   We do return the entire contents of the feed 
so there is certain data returned for one type of feed that's
not returned for another.

The format of the returned data is lisp list in what we
call lxml format.   In lxml format the car of the list is
either a symbol or a list beginning with a symbol.  The cdr
of the list are lists in pxml format.

The form returned has this format:

(net.rss:rss 
        ...
        (net.rss:version "version value") 
        ....
        (net.rss:channel ....)
        (net.rss:channel ....)
        ...)

the way to read the description above is that the returned value
is a list which begins with the symbol net.rss:rss

In the cdr of the list you'll find a version value and one or
more channel values.  The locations of the version and channel
values are not specified so you must search for them in the cdr
of the returned value.

The version value is always supplied and will be "0.91" "1.0 or "2.0".
As we extend this rss reader to handle other feed type you will
find other version values.

The interesting information in the feed is stored in the channel
value.  The format of the channel value list is

(net.rss:channel
   ...
   (net.rss:link "url")
   (net.rss:description "text") 
   (net.rss:pubDate "date")
   (net.rss:all-items  
        (net.rss:item ...)
        (net.rss:item ...)
        (net.rss:item ...)
        (net.rss:item ...)
        (net.rss:item ...)
        ...
))


There are other values as well depending on the rss version.
The url is the url to read the data on this channel.  This is
likely the url you passed to read-feed already.

The data for the feed is stored in the net.rss:item values which
are all stored in the net.rss:all-items value.

Each net.rss:item value looks like

(net.rss:item
    (net.rss:title "text")
    (net.rss:link  "url")
    (net.rss:description "text")
    (net.rss:pubDate "date")
    ..)

The net.rss:title is a brief description of the news item.
The net.rss:description is a more detailed description
of the item and the net.rss:link points to the complete item.




  





(feed-rss-p feed &optional version)
    Given a feed (i.e the result of read-feed) return the version
number (a string) of the feed if it is indeed a valid feed.
If version is given then compare the given version number
against the actual version number of the feed and if they
don't match return nil.





(feed-slot-value feed slot-name)
    Given a feed (the return value of read-feed) return the value
    assocated with the given slot-name.  The value is the cdr
    of the list beginning with either the slot-name or a list beginning 
    with slot-name. This function is useful for pulling values
     out of the feeds.

 e.g:

   (feed-slot-value '(net.rss:rss (net.rss:version "1.0")) 'net.rss:version)
   ->
    ("1.0")


    or

    (feed-slot-value '(net.rss:rss ((foo) "bar")) 'foo)
    ->
    ("bar")



Here are examples of reading rss version 0.91, 1.0 and 2.0 feeds.
All feeds are based on the same information but you'll see that
the return values from the feeds have different amount of information
since each version of rss permits different amounts of information
to be presented.
