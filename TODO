TODO:

high:

- test date parser to make sure timezone is correct

- For shows like The Daily Show that have their episodes canonicalized,
  I really should save the original episode name when printing, so the
  user doesn't get confused.  That is S2013E86 isn't as recognizable as
  2013.03.28

- series dups not detected at config load time

medium:

- have reasonable defaults for defquality?  what about the other def*
  macros?

- for some feeds, don't really need defseries: could have a group
  option to download all series from the feed -- this would make it
  easier for people to get started, when they use a `favorites' feed

- a test suite for upgrades -- would love this, but it's hard, since I
  think I have to keep around older databases somewhere

- command line argument to purge backups?

- put a time limit on repacks????  If I integrate with xbmc's watched
  status, then this is really "don't download a repack if it's been
  watched"

low:

- handle filename format "SxEE" (as opposed to SxxExx) -- some feeds
  have this in the title... not really sure it's needed, since things
  work as is

- for URL fetch errors, only email once after N hours, or make it a
  config option what to do

- cache the episode to quality lookup -- this happens a lot and could
  speed things up -- doubtful, since I've never seen that in the
  profiles

- have a mode where the episodes *not* downloaded (but from the same
  series) are printed -- the ep.log shows this, so it's unclear it is
  needed...
