TODO:

high:

- for feeds that don't have a filename: fuzzy heuristic to get better
  series name: is there some other element we can use to do this for
  those feeds?

- episode numbering: see the tvt-big.xml feed:
  - eps like "13b" and "01b" in description
  - filenames with just S01 and no Enn
  - crazy things like "09 (7)" for ep# 7!
  - 00.special
  - 03 + 04
  - 12.01-25
  - 1xAll
  - 2.17

medium:

- really should refactor the code that parses episode #'s into one
  place... currently have 3 of them  :(

- have reasonable defaults for defquality?  what about the other def*
  macros?

- for some feeds, don't really need defseries: could have a group
  option to download all series from the feed -- this would make it
  easier for people to get started, when they use a `favorites' feed

- a test suite for upgrades -- would love this, but it's hard, since I
  think I have to keep around older databases somewhere

- command line argument to purge backups?

- put a time limit on repacks????  If I integrate with xbmc's watched
  status, then this is really "don't download a repack if it's been
  watched"

low:

- handle filename format "SxEE" (as opposed to SxxExx) -- some feeds
  have this in the title... not really sure it's needed, since things
  work as is

- for URL fetch errors, only email once after N hours, or make it a
  config option what to do

- cache the episode to quality lookup -- this happens a lot and could
  speed things up -- doubtful, since I've never seen that in the
  profiles

- have a mode where the episodes *not* downloaded (but from the same
  series) are printed -- the ep.log shows this, so it's unclear it is
  needed...
