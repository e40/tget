TODO:

high:

- if the feed can be retrieved but the download fails, the item should
  be retried next time -- currently, the database is updated and the
  item is never downloaded

- if transmission-remote doesn't exist, then it's not reported to the
  user

   10105: download: #<"top gear", S20E02 [high]>
   10105: cmd: transmission-remote foo.example.com:9091 ....
   10105:   exit status: 127
   10105:   stdout: nil
   10105:   stderr: /bin/sh: transmission-remote: command not found

- adding a new series to the config file and NOT using :catch-up
  causes the first episode to create a complete-to with the caught up
  episode

- new argument --ignore-episode: I want to add "Would I Lie to You?"
  but I downloaded S06 and S07E08.  I need to have some way to tell
  tget this.

- need a command line arg that shows gaps for series that have them

- for feeds that don't have a filename: fuzzy heuristic to get better
  series name: is there some other element we can use to do this for
  those feeds?

- episode numbering: see the tvt-big.xml feed:
  - eps like "13b" and "01b" in description
  - filenames with just S01 and no Enn
  - crazy things like "09 (7)" for ep# 7!
  - 00.special
  - 03 + 04
  - 12.01-25
  - 1xAll
  - 2.17

medium:

- really should refactor the code that parses episode #'s into one
  place... currently have 3 of them  :(

- have reasonable defaults for defquality?  what about the other def*
  macros?

- for some feeds, don't really need defseries: could have a group
  option to download all series from the feed -- this would make it
  easier for people to get started, when they use a `favorites' feed

- a test suite for upgrades -- would love this, but it's hard, since I
  think I have to keep around older databases somewhere

- command line argument to purge backups?

- put a time limit on repacks????  If I integrate with xbmc's watched
  status, then this is really "don't download a repack if it's been
  watched"

low:

- handle filename format "SxEE" (as opposed to SxxExx) -- some feeds
  have this in the title... not really sure it's needed, since things
  work as is

- for URL fetch errors, only email once after N hours, or make it a
  config option what to do

- cache the episode to quality lookup -- this happens a lot and could
  speed things up -- doubtful, since I've never seen that in the
  profiles

- have a mode where the episodes *not* downloaded (but from the same
  series) are printed -- the ep.log shows this, so it's unclear it is
  needed...
