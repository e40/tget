TODO:

- handle filename format "SxEE" (as opposed to SxxExx)
- test date parser to make sure timezone is correct
- a test suite for upgrades
- For shows like The Daily Show that have their episodes canonicalized,
  I really should save the original episode name when printing, so the
  user doesn't get confused.  That is S2013E86 isn't as recognizable as
  2013.03.28
- have a mode where the episodes *not* downloaded (but from the same
  series) are printed
- cache the episode to quality lookup -- this happens a lot and could
  speed things up
- put a time limit on repacks????
- series dups not detected at config load time
- for URL fetch errors, only email once after N hours, or make it a
  config option what to do
- command line argument to purge backups?
