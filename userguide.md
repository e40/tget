# tget - t0rrent get

tget grew out of my dissatisfaction with flexget's behavior and
configuration.  There were some things I couldn't get it to do, and
the configuration is clumsy, at best.  Coming from the Lisp world YAML
just sucks.

The main thing I wanted to do, though, was to set the download quality
based on time: wait 6 hours, then download the x264 SD version, but if
after 12 hours that version isn't available, then download the x264
720p version, and if either aren't available for 2 days then download
the XviD SD version.  That's not possible in flexget, and I tried.
Configuration in Lisp, on the other hand, is easy and natural.

tget isn't nearly as functional as flexget.  And, it only works
(currently) with two sites (TVT, BTN).
